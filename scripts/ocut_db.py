    """The label for one row of an entity panel, from the two CTE flags.

    ``kind`` is required rather than defaulted. A default would let a front end
    quietly render the old three-state label for every row and no test would
    notice, which is the failure this function exists to stop.

    ``calls`` is the row's own count in the panel's current window. Pass it and
    the label follows that window: a name with 0 calls reads ``installed``, not
    ``in use``, because a state column that disagrees with the row beside it
    ("in use" next to a 0) was the confusing half. ``ever_used`` stays the
    fallback for callers with no windowed count — the all-time headless reports
    — so both surfaces still agree when asked the same question.

    ``removed`` outranks ``in use`` deliberately: it is the half that is
    actionable, and "in use" for a name that is no longer on disk reads as an
    invitation to keep using it. A name that is installed and uncalled is
    ``installed``, not ``unused`` -- the panel's own call count already says
    whether it was called; this one carries only what the usage tables cannot.

    Read this on the Plugins panel and "installed" means **no evidence against**,
    not "used": ``plugin_usage`` is written by ``plugin/ocut-hook.js`` alone, so a
    plugin the hook never saw is installed and uncalled even when it ran a
    thousand times. That is a property of the label, not a hedge -- the same word
    on the Tools panel means the opposite, and M14 in the READMEs says so.

    For a kind with no census, the honest answer is `not reported` rather than
    `removed`: we never looked, which is not the same as looked and found
    nothing. It only ever applies where `installed` is 0, so a name that *is*
    in the inventory still reads installed or in use as before.

    ``removed`` and ``not reported`` are decided before the count is consulted,
    so a name that is gone reads the same in every window; only the choice
    between ``in use`` and ``installed`` follows the window.

    actually saw. It is *not* added into ``total_tokens``, because the host's total
