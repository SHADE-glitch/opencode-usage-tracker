"""Tests for the drill-down: which row opens what, at whose window, and what it prints.

The TUI has three levels — an entity tab, that entity's calls in the tab's own window,
and one call's fields — and each level hands identity to the next through a row key.
These tests follow that handoff, because every failure here is a disagreement between
two things the person sees at once: the title above a table, the counts in a header,
the row under the cursor, and the record it opens.

The fixture is its own on purpose. It needs **two MCP servers exposing the same tool
name** — the only shape that tells a (server, tool) key from a tool-only query — a call
whose message row is absent, which is how a real NULL reaches the detail screen, and
values longer than the cell cap on both sides of it (an opaque 40-character project id
and a 35-character tool name), because the cap is what makes the row key load-bearing.
The part shapes still come from `test_ocut_sync`, so the host rows are the same JSON
the indexer is tested against.
