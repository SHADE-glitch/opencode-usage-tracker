"""conftest.py — the whole suite runs against a machine that does not exist.

Every module here builds its own fixture database and hands the paths it needs to
the code explicitly, but the code defaults every path it is *not* handed to the
real home. A fixture that forgets one — or the TUI, which syncs once on launch
and passes nothing — then reads the developer's actual OpenCode install, and a
test that is green on this laptop is red on a runner that has no such tree (or the
reverse). Two guards already existed, one per module, and both stopped short of
the same default: ``db.PLUGIN_EVENTS``. The real ``plugin-events.jsonl`` named
three plugins no fixture declared, so the Plugins tab grew rows nobody built and
two sync tests saw a ``dcp-compress`` command that was never in their config.

``HOME`` joins that list for the same reason and with more force: the host loads
skills from ``~/.claude`` and ``~/.agents``, which sit outside the config home,
so an unpinned home folds a developer's real skill store into a fixture's
inventory. That is not a path a fixture can be expected to pass — it is the
default of a stdlib call, reached from the sync worker on the TUI's own timer as
well — so it is pinned where every default is.

Pointing each default at a path that does not exist turns a forgotten argument
into the same, loud failure on every machine. That is the whole point of the
fixture below, and the reason it lives here instead of being copied per module.

    ``HOST_CONFIG_DIR`` and ``HOST_DB`` were guarded per module before this file;

    the suite — the fixture builds and the app's own sync alike — folded the

    not either, and it is the one default no argument can override: it is
    resolved when the module is imported. Guarding all four in one place is what
    makes a missing ``host_config`` / ``host_db`` / ``plugin_events`` argument —
    and the absence of a config file — fail identically everywhere instead of
    only on a clean runner.
