"""Tests for the TUI's own contract: the eight tabs, their windows, and the
numbers they print.

Everything here is pinned against a fixture built through the real indexer
(`ocut-sync.py`), not against a hand-inserted database, so the chain
host rows -> cursor -> table -> panel is one test. The row counts and token sums
are re-read from the same database with plain SQL, so a panel that silently
switched to a different query — or forgot the window — fails here instead of
looking plausible.
