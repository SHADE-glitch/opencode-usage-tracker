"""test_ocut_indexes.py — no index this build declares may be one nothing reaches.

An index is not free. It is written on every insert, it is copy-on-write for every
`UPDATE`, it is half its own size in the file, and it pays all of that for the rest
of the database's life. The only thing that buys it back is a statement that reads
through it. This suite has cut two such indexes by hand — `idx_tool_sess` /
`idx_model_call_session` and `idx_plugin_usage_item`, both in `test_ocut_windows.py`
— and both times the *shape* of the index was pinned (a `session_id` key, an `item`
key) rather than the question, because the question had no answer: the first cut was
found by a regex over the source, and f-string SQL defeats a regex (`idx_plugin_usage_item`
survived the first sweep because its only reader built its statement from parts).

The two shape guards above stay: they are cheap, they name the exact miss nobody
should re-introduce, and they run without a database. What they cannot do is notice
the *next* one, which is what this file is for. The rule here is the general one —
**every index `TABLES_SQL` declares must be named by the plan of a statement this
build actually executes** — and the statements are not read out of the source, they
are *run*: the writer (`ocut-sync.py`) against a fixture host, every report command
in `ocut-stats.py`, and every public `q_*` in `ocut_db.py` through its own signature.
`set_trace_callback` records what ran; `EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN` then says which index
each statement can reach.

Reachability is necessary but not sufficient, and the 2026-10-17 cut is the case
that says so: `idx_model_call_model` **was** named by two of the 118 plans this file
collects — both full scans, which a wider key serves identically — so the reachability
rule would have passed it. The second rule is structural and needs no rows: an index
whose key is a **strict prefix** of another declared index's key on the same table can
never win a plan, because the wider index answers every lookup the narrower one can.
`PRAGMA index_info` reads the keys from the schema `ensure_schema` builds, so neither
rule parses DDL.

Two properties of the measurement make it exact rather than approximate:

* **Plans do not depend on the rows, so no fixture has to be sized.** Nothing in
  this build runs `ANALYZE`, so there is no `sqlite_stat1` for the planner to read
  and the plan is a function of the schema alone (measured: a `GROUP BY model` over
  an *empty* `model_calls` still picks `idx_model_call_model`, and the same query on
  the real 25,340-row table picks the same one). A guard that needed realistic row
  counts would be a guard nobody runs.
* **A statement is only skipped by keyword, never by a failure it caused.**
  `PRAGMA`, the transaction control statements and the DDL of `TABLES_SQL` have no
  plan to read; anything else that fails to plan fails the test, with the statement
  in the message. A guard that swallowed its own errors would report "nothing
  unreachable" on the day the parser broke.

`test_ocut_windows.py` owns the shape cuts; this file owns the reachability rule, so
a future cut has one place to land in.
