"""test_conventions.py — the dimension-A layout layer cannot quietly rot.

The finalized layer at the root of this repository (STANDARD.md, outside this
repository, "Root files") is the one thing every other reader assumes. It is also
the one thing nothing enforces, because each of its entries is a *file name*: a
rename looks exactly like a deletion to every test that was written before it,
and `docs/` or `.github/workflows/` can vanish without a single suite noticing.

So the checks here are deliberately dull. They assert that the root layer is
present at the root, that this file's own AGENTS.md names the dimension in one
line instead of copying the standard's body, and that the runtime state the
ignore list covers is really ignored rather than merely commented about.

Two rules about how this file behaves, both from the standard it enforces:

* **Offline.** It reads the working tree and `git ls-files`. It never reaches the
  network and never reads the machine-wide standard, because a repository that
  cannot be checked offline is a repository that is only checked on one machine.
* **Nothing here is written.** A failing layout check says which entry is missing
  and where it belongs; it does not create the file.

It lives under `scripts/tests/`, so `pytest scripts/tests` and
`unittest discover -s scripts/tests` collect it with no change to either entry
command and no change to CI.

Standard library only.
