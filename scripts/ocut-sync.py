"""ocut-sync — index OpenCode's own database into the tracker database.

Passive reader: opens ``~/.local/share/opencode/opencode.db`` **read-only** and
copies what it needs into the tracker's own SQLite file. Nothing here ever writes
to OpenCode's directories or its database; the write path is a single
``sqlite3.connect`` of the tracker file.

    python3 scripts/ocut-sync.py            # incremental
    python3 scripts/ocut-sync.py --full     # wipe tracker tables, re-index all
    python3 scripts/ocut-sync.py --quiet    # for the TUI's 30-second worker

Why SQLite and not transcripts: CodeBuddy's tracker tails ``*.jsonl`` files with
byte offsets, because there the transcript *is* the record. OpenCode keeps its
sessions in one SQLite file, so the cursor is a rowid, not an offset — and that
swap is where all the interesting problems come from (see the cursor rules).

# Everything ocut assumes about OpenCode's persisted data: which tables are read,
# which record types and fields are parsed, which tool names drive classification,
# and which paths the inventory is scanned from. Re-verify this block when
# OpenCode ships a new version; AGENTS.md points here.
#
# Two kinds of entry, on purpose:
#   * Values reached through a call (table names, part types, tool names, config
#     keys, globs) are named constants used at their sites, so a rename is one
#     edit and a half-applied rename cannot hide.
#   * Record *field names* stay inline in the handlers — a parser is easier to
#     trust when the field it grabs is visible — and are mirrored in the
#     ``*_FIELDS`` sets below.
# ``scripts/tests/test_ocut_sync.py`` locks both directions: no field may be read
# without being registered, and no registered field may go unread.
#
# Why this exists at all: a renamed field raises nothing. It reads as NULL, the
# panel empties, ``ocut sync`` prints "done", CI stays green. The ``unparsed``
# counter is the runtime signal; this registry is the surface it is measured

# Cursor rules — the reason this is not just "SELECT * WHERE rowid > cursor".
#
# 1. A rowid cursor cannot see a row that CHANGES after it was consumed. Exactly
#    one thing here does: a tool part in ``running`` state, which the host UPDATEs
#    in place when the call finishes. So the cursor is held back at the first
#    non-final part in a batch and the next run re-reads it; the re-read writes
#    with OR REPLACE, so the final status wins. Holding is capped: a part that
#    never finishes (an interrupted session) would pin the cursor forever, so
#    past ``MAX_HELD_ROWS`` rows it is recorded, written as it stands, and passed.
# 2. A rowid cursor cannot see a row that was DELETED. Deletions are routine here
#    (max rowid 147,418 over 92,858 live parts). Rows we already indexed for a
#    pruned transcript stay in the tracker on purpose — it is an index of history,
#    and the alternative would silently forget sessions that happened. The count
#    drop is recorded in ``sync_state.note`` so it is visible, never inferred.
# 3. A rowid cursor is meaningless if the table was rebuilt under it. If the
#    host's ``max(rowid)`` is now *below* our cursor, rowids have been renumbered:
#    the cursor is reset and everything is re-read (idempotent, because every row
#    is keyed by the host's own id).
# 4. ``session`` is not cursor-read at all. Its cost/token columns are a running
#    rollup the host rewrites for the life of the session, and 323 rows is nothing
#    — the whole table is re-read and upserted every run. That is the honest
#    answer to a mutable table, and it is why sessions and model_calls can be

    ``home`` does the same job for the external skill roots, which sit *outside*

    a developer's real skills into a fixture's inventory. It is a parameter rather
