# Measurements

Every number in this repository that is a **measurement** — a size, a duration, a rate, a
count — came out of a run, not out of the code. Code holds pins; runs hold measurements.
This file is the runs: the exact commands, what each one touches, and how to tell whether a
number quoted somewhere else is still alive.

It exists because a checklist that carries numbers with no command beside them goes stale
in silence. A number nobody can re-measure is a claim, not data.

This file is **English only**, like the rest of `docs/maintenance/`. The bilingual parity
gates in `test_readme.py` cover README ×2 and MAINTENANCE ×2; a `docs/maintenance/` file has
no twin, so it is linked from both checklists instead, which
`test_the_maintenance_docs_are_linked_from_both_checklists` enforces.

---

## 0. How to use this file

1. **Date every reading.** Write `2026-10-13: …` beside any number you copy out of a run. A
   count with no date will be read as current forever.
2. **Never copy a count into a document that has no command beside it.** That is a hard rule
   in [`MAINTENANCE.md`](../../MAINTENANCE.md) §0, which points here instead of holding numbers
   of its own. This file is the exception by construction: every number below is dated, tied
   to the command that printed it, and marked as a reading.
3. **Tell the three kinds of number apart.** *a pin* — the code asserts it and drift fails a
   test (`name_cap = 28`, `SCHEMA_VERSION`, `BACKUP_KEEP = 5`, textual `>=8.2,<9`); *a
   measurement* — true at a timestamp on one machine (everything below); *a reading of a
   file another process appends to* — our own sidecar, which the hook writes between runs.
4. **`ocut health` is the aggregate; these recipes are the parts.** When a line looks wrong,
   §2–§6 say which side of which promise it belongs to.

```bash
ocut --help
ocut health
```

Every recipe here was run on the host described at the end of
[`compatibility.md`](compatibility.md) §1. The output shown is what that host said that day —
an example of the *shape* of a reading, never an acceptance criterion.

---

## 1. The pins this file leans on, and where each one lives

A recipe below prints a number the code also asserts. Those are **not** measurements — they
are the same value read from the code — and they are listed here so a reader who meets `28`
knows it came from `ocut_db.DEFAULTS`, not from a run.

| Pin | Value lives at | Where this file uses it |
|---|---|---|
| `name_cap` | `ocut_db.py` `DEFAULTS["name_cap"]` | §3 — the widest cell a table renders before a name is clipped |
| `SCHEMA_VERSION` | `ocut_db.py` | §2 — the view-redefinition counter; a bump clears the cursors |
| `BACKUP_KEEP` | `ocut_db.py` | §5 — how many managed snapshots retention keeps |

If one of them moves, this file moves with it and
`test_measurements_quotes_the_cap_the_code_actually_resolves` is what complains.

```bash
python3 - <<'PY'
import sys; sys.path.insert(0, "scripts")
import ocut_db as db
print("name_cap =", db.DEFAULTS["name_cap"], "columns")
print("SCHEMA_VERSION =", db.SCHEMA_VERSION)
print("BACKUP_KEEP =", db.BACKUP_KEEP)
PY
```

2026-10-13: `name_cap = 28 columns`, `SCHEMA_VERSION = 2`, `BACKUP_KEEP = 5`. The 28 is
measured on real data, not a round number — every entity name fits it, only the project path
does not.

---

## 2. Database: shape, integrity, size

Read-only by construction: `mode=ro` in the URI, so nothing in this recipe can move the
file's mtime or take a write lock.

```bash
DB="$HOME/.local/share/opencode-usage-tracker/usage.db"
python3 - "$DB" <<'PY'
import os, sqlite3, sys
path = sys.argv[1]
print("size", os.path.getsize(path), "B")
con = sqlite3.connect(f"file:{path}?mode=ro", uri=True)
for q in ("pragma user_version", "pragma journal_mode", "pragma integrity_check"):
    print(q, "->", con.execute(q).fetchone()[0])
for t in ("tool_calls", "model_calls", "skill_usage", "agent_usage", "mcp_usage",
          "plugin_usage", "sessions", "inventory", "unparsed"):
    print(t, con.execute(f"select count(*) from {t}").fetchone()[0])
PY
```

2026-10-13: `integrity_check ok`, `journal_mode wal`, and non-zero `tool_calls` / `sessions`
/ `model_calls` rows. What is safe to assert: `integrity_check` must read `ok`; a row count
that drops without an explicit rebuild is the story, not the number; `size` shrinks only when
something rewrites the whole file.

2026-10-17: **a `VACUUM` is a second way to make that happen**, and the sentence above used to say
"only under a rebuild", which is now wrong. `sqlite3 "$DB" "VACUUM"` (after `ocut backup`, snapshot
`usage-20261017-075432-manual.db`, 20,824,064 B) took the file from **20,824,064 B to 17,735,680 B**
— 5,084 pages to 4,330 of 4 KiB — with nothing rebuilt and nothing re-read: 592 of the pages it gave
back were the freelist D-073 left behind (dropped indexes park their pages, they do not release
them), and the rest was slack inside the pages. Rows came through untouched: 31,150 `tool_calls`,
25,340 `model_calls`, 368 `sessions`, 327 `plugin_usage`, ≈ 58k in all. Every table and every view
hashed identical to the pre-`VACUUM` snapshot, `quick_check` / `integrity_check` are `ok` with no
foreign-key violation, and `ocut health` printed the same bytes before and after. Read it as a
maintenance action and not as something the tool does on its own: since 2026-10-17 it *is* a
subcommand — `ocut vacuum` snapshots the file first, runs this `VACUUM`, and prints the same two
sizes plus the pages and freelist on each side, checking `quick_check` and every row count against
its own "before" — but it still only runs when somebody asks, and the file returns to this size
between compactions only as the hook writes again, since the freelist is what keeps it from growing
past its high-water mark.

2026-10-17: **what one index costs, and the reading that cut it.** `TABLES_SQL` declared
`idx_model_call_model` on `model_calls(model)` — a single column that `idx_model_call_model_ts`
already leads with. The recipe builds a fresh schema twice at **this database's own row count**,
adds the index back to one of them by hand and times a full insert pass into each (three passes,
mean), then does the same to a copy of the live file to see what the index occupies today. The
index is created by the recipe and not by `ensure_schema`, because the schema no longer declares
it — a bare `DROP INDEX` on the cut side would fail, and a comparison against a schema that never
had it is not a measurement of the cut.

```bash
cd <repo> && python3 - <<'PY'
import os, shutil, sqlite3, sys, time
sys.path.insert(0, "scripts")
import ocut_db as db
WITH_INDEX = "CREATE INDEX idx_model_call_model ON model_calls(model)"
src = sqlite3.connect(f"file:{db.DB_PATH}?mode=ro", uri=True)
ROWS = src.execute("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM model_calls").fetchone()[0]
COLS = [r[1] for r in src.execute("PRAGMA table_info(model_calls)")]
src.close()
INSERT = (f"INSERT INTO model_calls({', '.join(COLS)})"
          f" VALUES({', '.join('?' * len(COLS))})")
NUMERIC = {"ts", "prompt_tokens", "completion_tokens", "reasoning_tokens",
           "cache_read", "cache_write", "total_tokens", "usage_available"}
VALUES = [tuple(1 if c == "usage_available" else
                (i if c in NUMERIC else f"{c}-{i}") for c in COLS)
          for i in range(ROWS)]
for cut in (False, True):
    path = f"/var/tmp/cost-{'cut' if cut else 'kept'}.db"
    conn = sqlite3.connect(path)
    db.ensure_schema(conn)
    if not cut:
        conn.execute(WITH_INDEX)
    conn.commit()
    start = time.perf_counter()
    for _ in range(3):
        conn.execute("DELETE FROM model_calls")
        conn.executemany(INSERT, VALUES)
        conn.commit()
    conn.execute("VACUUM")
    print(f"{'without' if cut else 'with'} idx_model_call_model:",
          round((time.perf_counter() - start) / 3 * 1000, 1), "ms per pass,",
          round(os.path.getsize(path) / 2 ** 20, 2), "MiB")
    conn.close()
for cut in (False, True):
    path = f"/var/tmp/real-{'cut' if cut else 'kept'}.db"
    shutil.copy(db.DB_PATH, path)
    conn = sqlite3.connect(path)
    conn.execute("DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_model_call_model")
    if not cut:
        conn.execute(WITH_INDEX)
    conn.execute("VACUUM")
    conn.close()
    print(f"{'without' if cut else 'with'} it, on a copy of the live file:",
          round(os.path.getsize(path) / 2 ** 20, 2), "MiB")
PY
```

2026-10-17 reading: **177.7 ms with the index against 143.0 ms without** per 25,340-row insert
pass and **6.73 MiB against 6.28 MiB** on the built schema, and **16.90 MiB against 16.15 MiB**
on a copy of the live file — 0.75 MiB, 4.4% of it.

**What it cost on the read side, measured the same day.** The cut was first justified as "no
plan names it", and that reading was wrong: `idx_model_call_model` is named by **3 of the 118**
statements `scripts/tests/test_ocut_indexes.py` collects — the single-model summary
(`SELECT COUNT(*) … WHERE model = ?`, a `SEARCH … (model=?)`) and the two per-model roll-ups
(`SELECT model, provider, COUNT(*) … GROUP BY model, provider`), which scan the table and sort
in a temp B-tree either way. Copy the live file twice, `DROP INDEX` on one, plan every statement
in a fresh connection on each side, and print the ones whose plan moved:

```bash
cd <repo> && python3 - <<'PY'
import shutil, sqlite3, sys, tempfile
from pathlib import Path
sys.path.insert(0, "scripts"); sys.path.insert(0, "scripts/tests")
import ocut_db as db, test_ocut_indexes as T
SQLS = sorted({s for s in T._run_everything(Path(tempfile.mkdtemp()))
               if " ".join(s.split()).split()[0].upper() in T.PLANNABLE})
def side(cut):
    f = Path(f"/var/tmp/ocut-plan-{'cut' if cut else 'kept'}.db")
    shutil.copy(db.DB_PATH, f)
    a = sqlite3.connect(f)
    a.execute("DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_model_call_model")
    if not cut:                                   # the sweep retires it on the next open
        a.execute("CREATE INDEX idx_model_call_model ON model_calls(model)")
    a.commit(); a.close()
    plans = {}
    for sql in SQLS:                              # the captured text is literal: no binds
        c = sqlite3.connect(f); c.row_factory = sqlite3.Row
        plans[sql] = " | ".join(r["detail"] for r in c.execute("EXPLAIN QUERY PLAN " + sql))
        c.close()
    return plans
kept, cut = side(False), side(True)
moved = [s for s in kept if kept[s] != cut[s]]
print(len(kept), "statements,", len(moved), "with a different plan")
for sql in moved:
    print("\n---", " ".join(sql.split())[:120])
    print("  with the index:", kept[sql])
    print("  without       :", cut[sql])
PY
```

Reading: **3 of 118 plans differ**, and all three swap `idx_model_call_model` for
`idx_model_call_model_ts`. The equality lookup keeps its `SEARCH … USING INDEX (model=?)` shape —
the wider key leads with the same column, so it is the same lookup — and the two roll-ups keep
their `SCAN model_calls USING INDEX` plus a temp B-tree for the `GROUP BY`: one covering key for
another, and no plan gains or loses a `SEARCH`. Timed over 300 runs each on the same copies:
**27.8 ms against 28.1 ms** (requests) and **28.4 ms against 28.0 ms** (responses) — inside the
run-to-run spread, and the sign flips between the pair, so what the read side pays is the scan,
not which covering key it walks. The timing needs a real `ts` bound: the captured corpus carries
the fixture's `ts < NULL`, which the wider key alone can answer from the index (5.1 against 1.4
ms) and which no report run produces.

Both halves of the claim have a check, and they are **different rules**: reachability — every
declared index is named by the plan of a statement this build runs — is
`test_no_declared_index_is_unreachable_from_a_statement_the_code_runs`, and the one that
actually finds a prefix duplicate is `test_no_declared_index_is_a_prefix_of_a_wider_one`. The second is
structural (`PRAGMA index_info`, no rows needed) and is what flags this index when it is put
back. Re-take this when the row counts change by an order of magnitude, and note that the *plan*
half of the claim does not depend on the rows at all (`ANALYZE` is never run, so there is no
`sqlite_stat1` for the planner to read).

---

## 3. The TUI: what a page refresh costs, and the clipping cap

**Copy the database first. Do not run a timing recipe against the live one.** The clipping
cap itself is a pin (28 columns, §1); the reading here is the refresh cost.

```bash
cd <repo> && .venv/bin/python - <<'PY'
import asyncio, importlib.util, os, sqlite3, sys, time
SRC = os.path.expanduser("~/.local/share/opencode-usage-tracker/usage.db")
DST = "/tmp/ocut-measure-copy.db"
BEFORE = os.path.getmtime(SRC)
src = sqlite3.connect(f"file:{SRC}?mode=ro", uri=True)
dst = sqlite3.connect(DST); src.backup(dst); src.close(); dst.close()
spec = importlib.util.spec_from_file_location("ocut_m", "scripts/ocut-tui.py")
mod = importlib.util.module_from_spec(spec); sys.modules["ocut_m"] = mod
spec.loader.exec_module(mod)
async def main():
    app = mod.TrackerApp(db_path=DST)
    async with app.run_test(size=(120, 40)) as pilot:
        t0 = time.perf_counter(); await pilot.pause()
        return (time.perf_counter() - t0) * 1000
print("first paint + one frame ms:", round(asyncio.run(main()), 1))
print("live db mtime moved?", os.path.getmtime(SRC) != BEFORE)
PY
```

2026-10-13: `live db mtime moved? False`, and the first paint plus one frame in the tens of
milliseconds on this host. The resolved `name_cap` is **28 columns**: a table cell wider than
28 columns is clipped to a prefix and the status line says how many columns sit past the
right edge. Re-take this when the layout or the row counts change materially.

---

## 4. The plugin-usage sidecar: how fast it fills

The one input that is ours, and the only one that can be truncated by its own writer.

```bash
SIDECAR="$HOME/.local/share/opencode-usage-tracker/plugin-events.jsonl"
python3 - "$SIDECAR" <<'PY'
import collections, os, sys, json
path = sys.argv[1]
if not os.path.exists(path):
    print("no sidecar — the hook has never run"); raise SystemExit
size = os.path.getsize(path)
kinds = collections.Counter()
with open(path, encoding="utf-8", errors="replace") as fh:
    for line in fh:
        line = line.strip()
        if not line:
            continue
        try:
            kinds[json.loads(line).get("t", "?")] += 1
        except ValueError:
            kinds["unparseable"] += 1
print(f"size={size:,} B  cap={8*1024*1024:,} B  rotated={size > 8*1024*1024}")
print(dict(kinds))
PY
```

2026-10-13: a small sidecar well under the 8 MiB cap, with `surface` and `call` records and
no `unparseable` lines. A sidecar that reads `rotated=True` has been truncated by the hook;
the reader notices and re-reads from the start.

---

## 5. Snapshots, retention and the health aggregate

```bash
BACKUPS="$HOME/.local/share/opencode-usage-tracker/backups"
python3 - "$BACKUPS" <<'PY'
import datetime, os, sys
d = sys.argv[1]
names = sorted(n for n in os.listdir(d) if n.endswith(".db")) if os.path.isdir(d) else []
now = datetime.datetime.now(datetime.timezone.utc)
print(f"{len(names)} snapshot(s) in {d}")
for n in names:
    st = os.stat(os.path.join(d, n))
    age = now - datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(st.st_mtime, datetime.timezone.utc)
    print(f"  {n}  {st.st_size:,} B  {age.total_seconds()/86400:.1f} d old")
PY
```

2026-10-13: a handful of snapshots, all inside the managed directory, the newest of them
recent. Retention keeps the newest `BACKUP_KEEP` (5) by mtime.

```bash
ocut health; echo "exit $?"
```

2026-10-13: `exit 0`, the host database found, the schema version equal to `SCHEMA_VERSION`,
and `unparsed 0 — every record type was claimed`. The `unparsed` line is the aggregate this
whole file is arranged around: a non-zero value is the format-move signal.

---

## 6. The suite, and the run that proves the suite is the machine's

```bash
python3 -m pytest scripts/tests -q                       # system interpreter
.venv/bin/python -m pytest scripts/tests -q              # the venv the launcher uses
.venv/bin/python -m pytest scripts/tests -q -n auto      # the same suite, pytest-xdist
```

2026-10-13: the suite is green on both. **Do not copy the pass total into a document** — it
is a run, with an interpreter and an installed-textual set behind it, and the two
interpreters can differ in whether the TUI files are skipped. If a run reports fewer passes
than the last, the diff to look at is `git log --oneline -- scripts/tests`, not the number.

2026-10-17: `-n auto` on this host (18 cores, `pytest-xdist` 3.8.0, `.venv` python 3.13.14,
pytest 9.1.1, textual 8.2.8) finishes the same suite in **26.2 s against 175.7 s** serial — and
reports the same `322 passed, 3 subtests passed`, which is the reading that matters: the flag
moves the wall clock, not the set of checks. It is opt-in (`requirements-dev.txt`), and the
reason it is a flag and not an `addopts` is in MAINTENANCE.md §11. Useful when a red-check loop
is being run several times in a row; not useful as the gate's definition, because the number a
maintainer reads should come from the command the documentation names.

2026-10-22: the suite now stands at `381 passed, 3 subtests passed`; `-n auto` on the same host
finishes it in **32.3 s against 219.4 s** serial, with the same totals — the flag still moves the
wall clock, not the set of checks.

---

## 7. Recording a reading

When a number from this file goes into another document, write it in this shape:

```
measured 2026-10-13 on <OpenCode release> / python3 <ver> (+ .venv <ver>), textual <ver>,
<command or §-number of this file> — <the number> — <what it is a bound of, if it is a bound>
```

The parts that are easy to skip and expensive to lose: **which command** (so it can be
re-taken), **which interpreter**, and **whether it is a bound** (a truncated sidecar read is
a floor). A reading that cannot be traced to a command in this file is not a measurement.
